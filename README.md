# LHCb

The included examples are for the CP asymmetry measurement lab experiment. These use the LHCb public data set, which can be obtained from the college [Share point](https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/mmccann_ic_ac_uk/EqbNn0TxhEZAotQ-M4lqTbgBx0xRTTRjC8kGH9EllcYqnA?e=2ADCmS). To run these templates, the following python packages are required, pandas, matplotlib, xgboost, scikit-learn, zfit.

## Available templates

1. `Template 1 - data access.ipynb` shows how to access the data, make some simple plots and simple selections.
2. `Template 2 - selection.ipynb` shows how to use machine learning to make more powerful selections.
3. `Template 3 - fitting.ipynb` shows how to use unbinned maximum likelihood fits to extract parameters from the remaining data.
